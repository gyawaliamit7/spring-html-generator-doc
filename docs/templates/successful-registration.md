You can adapt this code to send registration success emails in your application by replacing the sample content with actual user data and integrating it with your email sending mechanism.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

    // Generate registration HTML
    Template registrationTemplate = TemplateFactory.getTemplate(TemplateName.REGISTRATION_SUCCSS_BASIC);
    String html = registrationTemplate.generate(generateRegistrationContent());
    System.out.println(html);
}

 public static Content generateRegistrationContent() {
        Content content = new Content();
        content.setTitle("Welcome to Our Portal");

        List<String> descriptionList = new ArrayList<>();
        descriptionList.add("Thank you for registering with us. Your account has been successfully registered.");
        descriptionList.add("Please feel free to reach out to us for any questions or concerns regarding our services.");
        descriptionList.add("To get started, please click the button below:");
        content.setButtonContent("Get Started");
        content.setButtonLink("https://images.unsplash.com");
        content.setDescription(descriptionList);
        content.setImageUrl("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563694983011-6f4d90358083?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=687&q=80");
        content.setImageContent("Image Caption");

        List<String> footerNotes = new ArrayList<>();
        footerNotes.add("If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to contact us.");
        footerNotes.add("Best regards,<br> Your Company Name ");
        content.setFooterNotes(footerNotes);
        return content;
